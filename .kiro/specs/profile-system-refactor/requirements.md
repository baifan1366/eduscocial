# Profile System Refactor Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the profile system to follow proper architectural patterns with clear separation of concerns between API routes, hooks, components, and pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Layer Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API routes to handle database operations directly, so that data access is centralized and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the profile API is called THEN it SHALL use Supabase client directly in the route handler
2. WHEN profile data is requested THEN the API SHALL fetch from users table and user_interests table
3. WHEN profile data is updated THEN the API SHALL validate and save to the database
4. IF validation fails THEN the API SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN interests are fetched THEN the API SHALL join user_interests with hashtags and topics tables

### Requirement 2: Custom Hooks Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want custom hooks to manage API calls and state, so that components can focus on presentation logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component needs profile data THEN it SHALL use a custom hook
2. WHEN the hook is called THEN it SHALL fetch data from the API endpoint
3. WHEN data is updated THEN the hook SHALL handle optimistic updates and error states
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the hook SHALL provide error handling and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN loading states change THEN the hook SHALL provide loading indicators

### Requirement 3: Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to be presentation-focused, so that they are reusable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL import and use custom hooks for data
2. WHEN components need data THEN they SHALL NOT make direct API calls
3. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL handle loading and error states from hooks
4. WHEN user interactions occur THEN components SHALL call hook methods to update data
5. WHEN components are client-side THEN they SHALL be marked with 'use client'

### Requirement 4: Page Component Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want page components to be server components, so that they can benefit from server-side rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page components are created THEN they SHALL NOT use 'use client' directive
2. WHEN pages need client functionality THEN they SHALL delegate to client components
3. WHEN pages are rendered THEN they SHALL be server components by default
4. WHEN metadata is needed THEN pages SHALL export metadata objects
5. WHEN pages need dynamic data THEN they SHALL use server-side data fetching

### Requirement 5: Context Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want context to provide global state management, so that data can be shared across components efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context is used THEN it SHALL be client-side only
2. WHEN context provides data THEN it SHALL use custom hooks internally
3. WHEN context state changes THEN it SHALL notify all consuming components
4. WHEN context is created THEN it SHALL provide proper TypeScript types
5. WHEN context errors occur THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 6: File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want files organized by concern, so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes are created THEN they SHALL be in app/api/ directory
2. WHEN custom hooks are created THEN they SHALL be in hooks/ directory
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be in components/ directory
4. WHEN pages are created THEN they SHALL be in app/[locale]/ directory
5. WHEN contexts are created THEN they SHALL be in contexts/ directory

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper feedback during data operations, so that I understand the system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
2. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL show success notifications
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL show error messages with retry options
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show field-specific error messages
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 8: Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile data to be consistent across the application, so that changes are reflected everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data is updated THEN all components SHALL reflect the changes
2. WHEN multiple components use profile data THEN they SHALL show consistent information
3. WHEN data is cached THEN it SHALL be invalidated appropriately
4. WHEN optimistic updates are used THEN they SHALL be rolled back on errors
5. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully
