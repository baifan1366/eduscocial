# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the current application from raw fetch calls to a centralized API layer using React Query (TanStack Query v5). The goal is to improve data fetching, caching, error handling, and overall developer experience by creating a unified API abstraction layer and replacing all direct fetch calls throughout the frontend with React Query hooks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized API layer with React Query, so that I can have consistent data fetching, caching, and error handling across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API layer is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a centralized `lib/api.js` file with all API endpoints
2. WHEN React Query is configured THEN the system SHALL provide query client setup with appropriate default configurations
3. WHEN API functions are called THEN the system SHALL return standardized response formats with proper error handling
4. WHEN the API layer is used THEN the system SHALL support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP methods with consistent interfaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React Query hooks for all API calls, so that I can benefit from automatic caching, background refetching, and loading states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React Query hooks are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide custom hooks for each API endpoint (useGetPosts, useCreatePost, etc.)
2. WHEN hooks are used THEN the system SHALL automatically handle loading, error, and success states
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL cache responses and provide stale-while-revalidate behavior
4. WHEN mutations occur THEN the system SHALL invalidate related queries and update the cache appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace all raw fetch calls in components, so that the application uses the new React Query system consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are updated THEN the system SHALL replace all direct fetch calls with React Query hooks
2. WHEN components use React Query hooks THEN the system SHALL properly handle loading states with appropriate UI feedback
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN data mutations happen THEN the system SHALL provide optimistic updates where appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved application performance and user experience, so that I can interact with the application more smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL show cached data immediately when available
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN data is stale THEN the system SHALL refetch in the background without blocking the UI
4. WHEN multiple components request the same data THEN the system SHALL deduplicate requests and share cached results
